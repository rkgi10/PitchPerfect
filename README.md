# PitchPerfect
An iOS app that records audio and lets user add effects to the recorded audio and listen. A just for fun app
This app lets user ecord their voice and add effects like Chipmunks and darthVader to their voice. It utilises the latest
AVAudioEngine library introduced in iOS 8.0 so it won't work on older iOS versions. The functionality that would
be added further would be:
1. Allowing the user to record his voice and pause and resume recording.
2. Add some more effects like reverb or echo.
